          <h2> History</h2>
          <p>
            As with other MMORPGs, players control a character avatar within a game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, completing quests and interacting with NPCs or other players.Twelve Sky does not require the player to pay for a subscription.

Each player can have 3 characters on a single account, with multiple accounts possible. To enter the game, the player must select a server. Each server acts as an individual copy of the game world and players can enter them freely with any character. Servers are all Player versus player (PvP) where open combat among players is common while including all aspects of Player versus environment (PvE) where players can defeat monsters and complete quests. On any server a player may create characters belonging to only a single faction; Guanyin,Fujin or Jinong on any single account.[6]

To create a new character players must choose between the factions of Guanyin,Fujin or Jinong. Characters from the factions can communicate and trade with only players of their faction and form guilds with only their faction. The player selects the new character's faction as Guanyin, Fujin or Jinong. Player can also choose gender and hair style/color and their avatar's name. Each faction has a unique appearance and set of skills available to them and players much choose their play style based on the attributes of the separate factions.
