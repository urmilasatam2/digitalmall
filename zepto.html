        <p>
          Zepto Life Technology is on a mission to innovate and develop a highly-sensitive and multiplexed immunoassay and molecular diagnostics technology platform that can quickly diagnose diseases and determine medical interventions using a handheld device.
<br><br><br>
The root of Zepto Life’s technology was based on the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) principle, a 2007 Nobel Prize winner in Physics. The company licensed the GMR biosensing technology from the University of Minnesota. Headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota, Zepto Life Technology became a privately-held company in 2014.
<br><br><br>
Since 2014, Zepto Life Technology has been designing and developing its proprietary Gigantic Magneto-Resistance (GMR) biosensing chips, on-chip bio-surface technology, magnetic nanoparticle immunoassay, and microfluidic technology. The scientific and engineering has since built a solid intellectual property portfolio.

          <h2> History</h2>
          <p>

Zepto Life’s first product is designed to measure D-Dimer and as an aid in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and in the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Its cardiac point-of-care handheld diagnostics system is designed to achieve:
<br><br><br>
• Lab Quality Results at Point-of-Care
<br><br><br>
• Simplicity and Versatilitybr
<br><br><br>
• Confidence and Trust in Product Quality
<br><br><br>
The company is also conducting advanced development and research to potentially expand its protein biomarkers technology to include molecular diagnostics in its product portfolio.
