          <h2> History</h2>
          <p>
            LG Corp. established as Lak Hui Chemical Industrial Corp. in 1947.[3] In 1952, Lak Hui (pronounced "Lucky", currently LG Chem) became the first South Korean company to enter the plastics industry. As the company expanded its plastics business, it established GoldStar Co. Ltd. (currently LG Electronics Inc.) in 1958. Both companies Lucky and GoldStar merged and formed Lucky-Goldstar in 1983.[4]

  GoldStar produced South Korea's first radio.[4] Many consumer electronics were sold under the brand name GoldStar, while some other household products (not available outside South Korea) were sold under the brand name of Lucky. The Lucky brand was famous for hygiene products such as soaps and HiTi laundry detergents, but the brand was mostly associated with its Lucky and Perioe toothpaste. LG continues to manufacture some of these products for the South Korean market, such as laundry detergent.

  Koo Bon-moo renamed the company to LG in 1995.[4] The company also associates the letters LG with the company's tagline "Life's Good". Since 2009, LG has owned the domain name LG.com.
<br><br><br>
  In July 2018, it was announced that Koo Kwang-mo, the only son of Koo Bon-moo, will be the new CEO citing "first son-only succession rule".[5] Koo Kwang-mo's father died of a brain tumor on May 20, 2018.[6]
